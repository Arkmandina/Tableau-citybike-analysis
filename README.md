May 2019 trip analysis

In this analysis, I took the the data from NYC city bikes in May of 2019. My main goal was too look to see if there were areas that were more popular than others, if more men or women were using city bikes and if there was a age discrepency in use and/or time used.

The first two notebooks showed a map visualization of the start station of a city bike as well as the end station. Since it's on a map of NYC, it allows you to visually see the differences in end and start points. Most of the popular stations are on the west side as well as end stations

Next I looked at trip duration. The intial time wasn't cohesive in providing immediate understanding upon viewing so I made a calculated field to provide the information in minutes.  The initial breakdown was age versus trip duration filtered from age 20 to 140. 

Unsurprisingly people aged 20 took the longest rides on city bikes averaging 60 minutes. Surprisingly people aged 90 and were taking about 50 minute bikes rides.

With the age calculated field, I also explored what start stations were frequented the most based on age. Not surprising but the stations located around Central Park seemed to be the most used regardless of age.

Next trips were broken down based on gender. A calculated field had to be used to seperate men from women. Unknown was also factored into the equation. Overall, trip durations were longer for unknown at over 35 minutes and next were men and then women. I then took that data, and broke it into a pie chart for a visual representation.

The above gender information was used to make my 2nd dashboard. 

The last thing I did was take each bikes individual bike ID to see if there were ones used more than others.

All the above information was used to make my story which outlined bike use mostly based on age and gender.
